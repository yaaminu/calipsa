### Calipsa Take Home 


### Running 
1. Bring up the backen server as instructed in ../backend/README.md
2. Run npm install && npm run dev
3. Head over to http://localhost:3000 and you'll be presented with a rudimentary vue app for browsing 
the alarm data


### But for time constraint, I would have: 
 - I would have extracted the alarms table into its own component and style it properly 
 - I would have extracted the pagination section into its own component and style it properly 
 - I would have implemented a detailed screen for each alarm and created a route for it.
 - I would have used a proper loading and error screen
 - I would have implemented the timeline page for showing a graph of events over time
 - I would have written tests
 - I would have collected the authentication credentials from the user as input instead of hardcoding it into the app
 - I would have bundled the frontend app and host it as a static asset in the backend service.
